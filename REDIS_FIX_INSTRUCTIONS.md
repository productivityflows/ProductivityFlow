# Redis Connection Fix for ProductivityFlow

## Problem
Your Flask application is failing because it's trying to connect to Redis at `localhost:6379` for rate limiting, but no Redis instance is available on Render.

## Quick Fix (Immediate Solution)

I've already updated your `backend/application.py` to properly handle Redis connection failures. The application will now:

1. Try to connect to Redis first
2. If Redis is not available, fall back to in-memory rate limiting
3. Continue working without crashing

**This fix is already applied and should resolve your immediate issue.**

## Proper Production Solution

For a production application, you should set up a proper Redis instance:

### Option 1: Using render.yaml (Recommended)

I've created a `render.yaml` file that will set up:
- A Redis Key Value instance for rate limiting
- Proper environment variable linking

To deploy with this:

1. Commit the `render.yaml` file to your repository
2. In your Render dashboard, create a new "Blueprint" instead of individual services
3. Connect it to your repository and let Render set up both the web service and Redis instance

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Create Redis Instance:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click "New" â†’ "Key Value"
   - Name it `productivityflow-redis`
   - Choose the same region as your web service
   - Set max memory policy to `allkeys-lru`
   - Click "Create Key Value"

2. **Update Web Service Environment Variables:**
   - Go to your web service in the Render dashboard
   - Go to "Environment" tab
   - Add environment variable:
     - Key: `REDIS_URL`
     - Value: Copy the "Internal Redis URL" from your Redis instance

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Your web service will automatically redeploy with the new environment variable

## Benefits of Using Redis

- **Shared rate limiting** across multiple server instances
- **Persistent rate limiting** that survives deployments
- **Better performance** for high-traffic applications
- **Future-ready** for caching and session storage

## Environment Variables Needed

Make sure these environment variables are set in your Render web service:

```
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-instance:6379
ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key
```

## Testing

After implementing either solution:

1. Check your application logs for: `Rate limiting configured with Redis` or `Rate limiting enabled with in-memory storage`
2. Test your API endpoints to ensure they're working
3. Your dashboard and tracker should now be functional

## Monitoring

- Monitor your Redis instance usage in the Render dashboard
- Consider upgrading from the free Redis tier to a paid tier for production workloads
- Set up alerts for Redis connection issues

The immediate fix has been applied, so your application should be working now. For long-term production use, consider implementing the proper Redis setup.
