# Flask before_first_request Fix

## Problem
The Flask application was failing to start with the error:
```
AttributeError: 'Flask' object has no attribute 'before_first_request'
```

This error occurs because the `@app.before_first_request` decorator was deprecated in Flask 2.2 and completely removed in Flask 3.0.

## Root Cause
The application was using the deprecated `@application.before_first_request` decorator to initialize database tables before the first request was processed:

```python
@application.before_first_request
def create_tables():
    """Create database tables before first request"""
    init_db()
```

## Solution Applied
The deprecated decorator and function have been removed and replaced with the existing modern database initialization approach:

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed deprecated decorator**: Eliminated the `@application.before_first_request` decorator usage
2. **Removed redundant function**: Removed the `create_tables()` function as it was redundant
3. **Leveraged existing solution**: The application already had a proper `initialize_database()` function that:
   - Uses the modern Flask application context approach
   - Includes robust error handling and retry logic
   - Is called during application startup (after model definitions)

### The Modern Approach:
```python
def initialize_database():
    """
    Initialize database with proper error handling and retries.
    """
    max_retries = 3
    retry_delay = 2
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            with application.app_context():
                # Test database connection first
                with db.engine.connect() as connection:
                    connection.execute(db.text("SELECT 1"))
                logging.info("Database connection successful!")
                
                # Create all tables if they don't exist
                db.create_all()
                logging.info("Database tables checked/created successfully!")
                return True
                
        except Exception as e:
            # Error handling and retry logic...
            
# Called during app startup
initialize_database()
```

## Benefits of the Fix
1. **Flask 3.0+ Compatibility**: The application now works with modern Flask versions
2. **Better Error Handling**: The new approach includes comprehensive error handling and retry logic
3. **More Robust**: Database initialization happens immediately on startup rather than waiting for the first request
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removed redundant code and leveraged existing, better implementation

## Verification
The fix has been tested and verified to:
- ✅ Remove all usage of deprecated `before_first_request`
- ✅ Maintain proper database initialization functionality
- ✅ Work with Flask 3.0+ requirements

## Migration Notes
If you encounter similar issues in other Flask applications:

1. Replace `@app.before_first_request` with application startup initialization
2. Use `with app.app_context():` for database operations
3. Consider adding error handling and retry logic for production robustness
4. Call initialization functions after all models are defined but before the app starts serving requests
