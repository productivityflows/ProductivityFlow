# Tauri Signing Issue Fix

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
Error A public key has been found, but no private key. Make sure to set `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.
```

This occurred because:
1. Both Tauri applications (`employee-tracker-tauri` and `manager-dashboard-tauri`) have updater configurations with public keys
2. When Tauri detects a public key, it expects a corresponding private key for signing updates
3. The GitHub Actions workflow was not providing the `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable during the build process

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY to GitHub Actions Workflow

Updated `.github/workflows/release-installers.yml` to include the environment variable in both build steps:

**Employee Tracker Build Step:**
```yaml
- name: Build the app
  run: npm run tauri build -- ${{ matrix.args }}
  working-directory: ./employee-tracker-tauri
  env:
    TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

**Manager Dashboard Build Step:**
```yaml
- name: Build the app
  run: npm run tauri build -- ${{ matrix.args }}
  working-directory: ./manager-dashboard-tauri
  env:
    TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

### 2. Fixed Updater Endpoint URLs

Updated the Tauri configurations to point to the correct updater manifest files:

**Employee Tracker** (`employee-tracker-tauri/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`):
```json
"endpoints": [
  "https://github.com/productivityflows/ProductivityFlow/releases/latest/download/latest-employee-tracker.json"
]
```

**Manager Dashboard** (`manager-dashboard-tauri/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`):
```json
"endpoints": [
  "https://github.com/productivityflows/ProductivityFlow/releases/latest/download/latest-manager-dashboard.json"
]
```

## Requirements

### GitHub Repository Secrets
Ensure that `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` is set as a repository secret in GitHub with the value:
```

```

## What This Fixes

1. **Build Process**: The Tauri build process will now have access to the private key for signing updates
2. **Update System**: Each application will check its own specific updater manifest file
3. **Security**: Updates will be properly signed and verified

## Next Steps

1. Ensure the `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` secret is set in the GitHub repository
2. Create a new release to test the build process
3. Verify that both applications build successfully without the signing error

## Notes

- The empty signatures in the updater manifests are acceptable for now - Tauri will handle the signing during the build process
- If you want to implement proper signature generation for the manifest files, additional tooling would be needed to sign the update packages themselves
- The current setup ensures the build process completes successfully while maintaining the updater functionality
